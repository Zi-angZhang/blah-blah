# Login-in ssh without password

I keeps forgetting the method to pass the [private key] to my machine to avoid typing passwords in logging in.



Here I would review the pipe line of ssh login and find out the difference between public keys and private keys.





```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-host
```



```sh
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```
