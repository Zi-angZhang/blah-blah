# Crush

Wow I was listening a song named "crush" by my favorite folk singer [Chen Li](http://www.gschenli.cn/), this song's title hint me that the word "crush" may have other means than "squeeze/ broken". I went to merriam-webseter found...



### Crush also means an intense and usually passing infatuation

where infatuation means a feeling of foolish or obsessively strong love for, admiration for, or interest in some one or something: __strong and unreasoning attachment__.

e.g. I have a crush on someone.
